   MS539 - Programming Concepts 
   GUI Assignment
   March 18, 2023

This assignment I initially expected this to take roughly 5 hours to complete.  
My expectation was to spend 1 hour per component.  However, I spend roughly 5 hours researching
and reviewing the course material.  Spent an additional 3 hours going back over the lectures to make
sure I did not miss any key topics.  The next step in building the forms took quite a bit of time roughly,
3-4 hours as I did not know how to properly align items and each component required some additional
research.  I believe the next assignment will be a considerable drop in time spent as the components needed
can be easily added.  I will spend more time on the syntax of the code I need versus understanding the component itself. 
 
 
 3/27/2023 - Update for the error expection handling process I estimated roughly 2 hours to complete the process and add this to the email address and the phone number field.  
This was a bit more daunting than I expected as I had to account for the various patterns assocaited to phone numbers and email addresses.  I had to research the regex and build a pattern associed
to the item I was checking.  In this case it was phone and email address.  I researched stack overflow and microsoft forums to find the correct patterns to use for checking for email and phone numbers.
As I researched I found you can use this for other custom formatting and it will beneficial for learning if I have to validate obscure formats in the future.  Some of the examples I can think of are 
product details, Social Security Numbers and other policy related information.  I ended up spending roughly 6-7 hours on this portion of the project.
