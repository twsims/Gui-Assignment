   MS539 - Programming Concepts 
   GUI Assignment
   March 18, 2023

This assignment I initially expected this to take roughly 5 hours to complete.  
My expectation was to spend 1 hour per component.  However, I spend roughly 5 hours researching
and reviewing the course material.  Spent an additional 3 hours going back over the lectures to make
sure I did not miss any key topics.  The next step in building the forms took quite a bit of time roughly,
3-4 hours as I did not know how to properly align items and each component required some additional
research.  I believe the next assignment will be a considerable drop in time spent as the components needed
can be easily added.  I will spend more time on the syntax of the code I need versus understanding the component itself. 
 
 3/27/2023 - Update for Error exception handling I estimated roughly 2 hours to complete the process.
This was a bit more daunting than I expected as I had to account for the various patterns associated to phone number

4/5/2023 - Updated creating a function to add a player to a team and this hould have been roughly 4 hours but I have been dealing with some 
medical setbacks and I had a stroke recently and it has been difficult to concentrate. I wanted to loop through all the controls on the form to 
store the data, but still trying to perfect the for each for a specific control.  I am unsure if I need to store it in a list then send it to a file or just cycle through the controls and 
write it directly to the file.  I also have some issues with the Git push as it erased all my local data and I had to write the code over. So that was unexpected.  I created a text file to store text from one text box
and created a random generator to pick a jersey number for a player. Still a week behind now with having to write the code over I may be 10 days behind.
